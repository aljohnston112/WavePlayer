We appreciate you feedback and kind support.

We have always wanted a shuffle algorithm that didn't play some songs as often as others and now it is reality.

Made and tested by music lovers.

Feel free to download PinkyPlayer and try it out.

Coming soon, you will be able to make a playlist with the songs the algorithm knows you like best, and to put in times for the algorithm (so it knows what you like at work/in the morning/at night).
